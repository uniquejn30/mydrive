## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: SQLite
- **Storage**: AWS S3
- **Authentication**: JWT with bcrypt
- **Deployment**: Docker

## Installation

1. Clone or extract the repository.
2. Navigate to the `src` and `public` directories and run `npm install` in each to install dependencies. Ensure you have Node.js installed.
3. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example` and set:

   ```env
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID= <your access key ID>
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY= <your secret access key>
   AWS_S3_REGION= <your s3 bucket region>
   AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME= <your s3 bucket name>
   JWT_SECRET= <your secret key>
   ```

4. Start the backend server:

   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

5. Start the frontend in development mode:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The frontend will run at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Production build

To generate an optimized production build of the frontend, run:

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

This builds the app for production and starts a server that serves the prebuilt pages.

### Docker Image
```bash
docker push uniquejn30/mydrive:tagname
```
